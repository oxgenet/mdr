## [0.4.0] - Unreleased (oxgenet fork)

First release of the oxgenet fork of mdr (https://github.com/oxgenet/mdr),
forked from Clever Cloud's v0.3.2. Copyright (c) 2026 oxge.net for
the modifications; original work (c) 2026 Clever Cloud, MIT.

### Added
- Webview **viewer mode** by default (no sidebar/toolbar) with a `⋮` menu to
  switch to **editor mode** (source + live preview, Cmd/Ctrl+S save) and toggle
  the table of contents; `--edit`, `--toc` flags and `mode`/`toc` config keys
- **CJK-aware rendering**: language resolution (front matter `lang:`, `--lang`,
  config `lang`, content detection, OS locale) sets `<html lang>`; `:lang()`
  font stacks for ja / zh-Hans / zh-Hant / ko for body, code, editor, Mermaid
- Leading YAML front matter is stripped from the rendered document
- CI: dependency refresh builds (macOS arm64/x64, Windows x64/arm64), Windows
  rendering screenshots, experimental iOS/Android compile checks
- `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, packaging templates under `packaging/`
- Remote image policy: https always, plain http only for localhost / private
  IP literals / `*.local` on common ports; blocked or failed images become
  placeholders. `--no-remote-images`, `--no-local-http`, config keys
- iOS document-based app (`ios/MdrApp`) and Share Extension; Windows CI screenshots

### Changed
- Default Cargo features are now `webview-backend` only (egui/tui opt-in)
- Package identity moved to the oxgenet namespace (Homebrew `oxgenet/tap/mdr`,
  Scoop bucket `oxgenet`, WinGet `oxgenet.mdr`); not published to crates.io

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- TOC panel in egui is now **resizable** by dragging its edge (#27)
- HTTP image fetching in TUI now has a **30-second timeout**
- `file_to_data_uri()` now rejects image files larger than **100 MB** to prevent OOM

### Fixed
- Replaced `std::mem::forget` with explicit `Box::leak` in `watcher.rs` (#16)
- Mermaid diamond-node panic reported upstream; workaround already in place (#4)
- `cargo binstall mdr` confirmed working (#22)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- TOC toggle in egui backend: press **F10** or click *Hide TOC / Show TOC* in the search bar (#32, #41)
- Window size and position persistence in egui backend via eframe's `persistence` feature (#43)
- System font loading in egui backend for non-Latin script support (CJK, etc.) (#31)
- Image file validation by magic bytes across all backends — invalid/mislabeled images render a visible placeholder instead of failing silently (#14)

### Fixed
- Headings inside fenced code blocks are no longer treated as section boundaries in egui (#30)

### Changed
- Cargo dependencies bumped:
  - `eframe` 0.33 → 0.34
  - `egui_commonmark` 0.22 → 0.23
  - `ratatui` 0.29 → 0.30
  - `ratatui-image` 4.2 → 11.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Highlight.js syntax highlighting for code blocks in the webview backend, with `prefers-color-scheme` GitHub light/dark themes embedded via `include_str!`. Injected only when fenced code blocks are present (#35) — thanks @njreid
- Custom KDL v2 grammar definition for highlight.js (#35)
- Fullscreen expand overlay for images and Mermaid diagrams in the webview backend, with hover button, double-click, and `Esc` to close (#34) — thanks @njreid
- User config file at `~/.config/mdr/config.kdl` (KDL v2) with `--init` to scaffold and `--config PATH` to override (#36) — thanks @njreid
- `system-ui` added to the default font stack for a native desktop look (#36) — thanks @njreid
- `with_devtools(true)` on the webview to enable in-app dev tools (#34)

### Fixed
- Webview backend crash on Linux/Wayland (`the window handle kind is not supported`). Switch to wry's GTK-native API (`WebViewBuilderExtUnix::build_gtk`) on Linux so the same binary works on X11 and Wayland (#33, closes #28) — thanks @njreid
- TUI backend now exits early when stdout is not a terminal. Without this, `enable_raw_mode()` succeeds on Windows pipes and the event loop spins forever — this was the cause of every `main` CI run being cancelled at the 6h timeout since February (#39)

### Changed
- Cargo dependencies bumped — major versions where drop-in (#40):
  - `comrak` 0.50 → 0.52
  - `mermaid-rs-renderer` 0.1 → 0.2
  - `resvg`, `usvg` 0.45 → 0.47
  - `tiny-skia` 0.11 → 0.12
  - `wry` 0.54 → 0.55
  - `tao` 0.34 → 0.35
  - `muda` 0.15 → 0.19
  - `ratatui-image` 4.1 → 4.2

### Internal
- `timeout-minutes: 90` added on the CI check job so a future regression of the kind that caused the 6-month outage fails fast

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Application window icon: both egui and webview backends now display the mdr logo as window icon

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `--list-backends` flag to display available backends at runtime
- Backend names shown in CLI help output

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Homebrew tap release workflow: remove broken copy action, fix heredoc syntax

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-22

### Security
- Path traversal protection for local file access
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in webview backend
- Regex caching to prevent ReDoS
- HTML encoding of user-controlled content (`html_encode`)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Windows build: move `[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]` section after optional deps in `Cargo.toml`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Mouse scroll support in TUI backend
- Mermaid diagram rendering as terminal images in TUI backend
- SVG image support in TUI backend
- Offline Mermaid rendering via embedded `mermaid.js`
- Project logo in README and documentation
- Verbose mode (`-v`) for debug output across all backends

### Fixed
- Image rendering consistency across egui, webview, and TUI backends
- Local image path resolution in TUI backend
- SVG images not displaying in webview backend (#10)
- SVG rendering in egui: rasterize to PNG instead of inline embedding (security fix)
- Mermaid rendering improvements in TUI and webview backends

### Changed
- SVG images rasterized to PNG in egui backend for consistency
- README updated with logo and LLM-era motivation section

- Packaging support: Homebrew, Nix, pre-built binaries
- Release infrastructure: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## [0.9] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Initial project bootstrap with egui and webview dual rendering backends
